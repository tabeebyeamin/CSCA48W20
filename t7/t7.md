# Agenda

+ Administrivia
+ Testing
+ Testing Practice


# Administrivia
+ Your midterms are being marked right now, at this very moment
+ Expect them done by early next week


# Testing
+ A **test case** is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application
+ it contains test steps, test data, precondition(s), postcondition(s) developed for specific test scenario to verify any requirement

# Why Test?
+ helpful to measure weather expectations of the client/instructor etc. were fulfilled or not
+ Helps you design correct code
+ Helps massively if you are collaborating with others on a code base
+ **Test Driven Development**: Writing tests first, code after. (You'll learn more in CSCB07, CSCC01 etc.)

# Design a test-suite for insertMovieReview()
```c
/**
Inserts a new movie review into the linked list, 
if it does not exist already.
*/
ReviewNode *insertMovieReview(char *title,
char *studio, int year, double BO_total,
int score, ReviewNode *head)
```

+ Describe the test in detail, e.g.:
    - Expected input to the function
    - What the expected result should be if correct
    - How to check that the result is as expected
    (no code is needed, but detail should be enough to implement)

# Test-suite for insertMovieReview
- Insertion into an empty list
    - (result is, new node should be at head, content should be correct,
    'next' pointer for head should be NULL)
- Insertion into a non-empty list
    - (result is, new node is at head, 'next' pointer points to old head,
    information is correct in both nodes)
- Trying to insert a duplicate movie
    - (should NOT insert anything)
- Inserting more than 2 movies, checking they are linked in the
    right order as expected, content is correct

# Design a test-suite for deleteMovieReview()
Perform the same exercise for deleteMovieReview
```c
/** Removes a review matching the input query 
from the linked list, if such review can be found. 
*/
ReviewNode *deleteMovieReview(char *title, 
char *studio, int year, ReviewNode *head)
```

# Test-suite for deleteMovieReview
- Deletion on an empty list (should not crash)
- Deletion on a list of length 1 (should delete the node and
    return NULL so head is updated to be an empty list)
- On a list with multiple entries:
    - Deletion at head
    - Deletion at tail
    - Deletion in the middle
    (for all of these, the linkage needs to be checked and
    verified correct)

# Design a test suite for sortReviewsByTitle()
Perform the same exercise for sortReviewsByTitle
```c
/** Sorts the list of movie reviews in
ascending order of movie title.
If duplicate movie titles exist,
the order is arbitrary.
*/
ReviewNode *sortReviewsByTitle(ReviewNode *head)
```

# Test-suite for sortReviewsByTitle
- Resulting list is actually sorted (how?)
- Resulting list has the exact same reviews as input (how?)
- No dangling pointers or endless loops
- Try multiple different input ordering and verify it works

# Notes
+ None of the tests above ask to check the *output* of the program!
+ It is always checking the information stored in the list, and the 
pointers linking things together!
+ We test for correctness, not output.
+ If it's correct, it will produce the right output. Not the other way
    around.
