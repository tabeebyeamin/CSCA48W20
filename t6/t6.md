# Agenda

+ Sorting Madness

Please go to: http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~strider/A48_programs/sorting_madness.c
And download the starter code!

# QSort()
- **YOUR TASK** is to update this program to work with an array of
integers instead
- be careful: The random array-filling produces numbers in [0,1],
if you just cast that to (int) you'll end up with an
array filled with zeros!


# QSort()
+ Comment out the printing statements
+ Make N=10000, then 1000000, then 10000000, and then 100000000
+ TIME how long it takes for qsort() to handle these inputs
 (in unix, this is easy, just use the time command:)

```
$ time ./a.out
Done!

real    0m32.278s
user    0m31.894s
sys     0m0.368s
```

(that's 100,000,000 random double numbers on Paco's 2012 laptop)

 So it's really very quick!

# QuickSort()

+ initialize the array so it produces a *sorted* array - a common misconception is
that qsort() is slow on an input that is already sorted. FALSE! so check it out just so we can put this false rumour to rest!

```
$ time ./a.out
Done!

real    0m7.229s
user    0m6.883s
sys     0m0.324s
```
