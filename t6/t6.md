# Agenda

+ Sorting Madness

Please go to: http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~strider/A48_programs/sorting_madness.c
And download the starter code!

# QSort()
- **YOUR TASK** is to update this program to work with an array of
integers instead
- be careful: The random array-filling produces numbers in [0,1],
if you just cast that to (int) you'll end up with an
array filled with zeros!
