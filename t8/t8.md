# BST Insert Practice
+ Build a Binary Search Tree by inserting the following numbers in order:

```c
56, 17, 24, 78, 67, 98, 5, 2, 15, 31, 71
```

Compare with your neighbours!

# BST Delete Practice
+ Delete 56 from the previous tree


# Flood Fill

+ Flood fill at point P, with value of "RED" and boundary "GREY"

![Flood Fill](./Floodfill.png)

# Flood Fill
+ Go to: `https://uoft.me/PacoFloodFill` and download the starter code
+ if you want a version that's easier to slightly easier to read: go
to my github and download the starter code in **t8/code**:
`https://github.com/tabeebyeamin/CSCA48W20/`

+ Implement the recursive function (floodFill_R)

+ Consider only the 4 neighbours up, down, left, and right - no diagonals.

+ Do it out on paper first!



# Recursion Tips
+ think like induction
+ start with your base case
+ think where you can put your recursive call
+ do it out on paper first

# Flood Fill
```c
void floodFill_R(char image[10][10],
int x, int y, char value, char bound) {
 // Base case: when at the bound or value, do nothing
  if (image[x][y] != bound && image[x][y] != value) {
      // assign the pixel to work with the base case
      image[x][y] = value;
      floodFill_R(_________________);
      floodFill_R(_________________);
      floodFill_R(_________________);
      floodFill_R(_________________);
  }
}

```
