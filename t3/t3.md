#  Pointers!
+ They are just a variable (like any other variable)
+ This means they get their own locker in the memory model
+ That locker will store a locker number for something else we want to access.

## Pointer Usage
```c
// store the address of x in pointer p
p=&x;	
/*store the address of the first element
 of stringy in pointer p*/
p=&stringy[0];
```

# Pointers!
+ Must match pointer type to variable type
```c
/*Copy the contents of locker (p) into x
here (p) stands for a locker number, the actual
locker number stored in p.*/
x=*(p);
/*Copy the contents of locker (p+1) into x.
(p+1) is a locker number, equal to whatever
locker number is stored in p, plus one.*/
x=*(p+1);
/*Make the contents of locker (p+2) 5. Again,
(p+2) is a locker number, whatever locker
number is stored in p, plus 2.*/
*(p+2)=5;
```

# Equivalence between arrays and pointers
+ The name of an array (by itself) is equivalent to the
expression `&array[0]` - it gives us a pointer to the
first entry in an array.

+ Thus, if a functions is declared as
```c
int sum_array(int *p);
```
And we have an array
```c
int array[10];
```
We can call the function as
```c
sum_array(array);
```
or
```c
sum_array(&array[0]);
```
These have identical meaning.

#  Modify the 'reverse' function
+ In lecture, you did:
```c
void reverse(char *input, char *output);
```

+ takes pointers to an input string and an
  output string, then uses pointer indexing to make the output be
  the reverse of the input string

# Mode the 'reverse' function
```c
void reverse(char *input)
```
+ reverses the string *in place*
+ use pointer indexing only, and not create any temporary arrays within
 reverse() 
+ i.e. can't first reverse the string into another 
 array and then copy the reversed one - have to swap
 things around as you go

```c
char input[6] = "ABCDEF";
reverse(input);
printf("%s\n", input);
```
